# Parallel-Processing-with--OMP-and-MPI
# **Several reasons to use parallel computing**

1.	Save time/money
2.	Solve Larger/More Complex problems like Web search engines/databases processing millions of transactions every second
3.	Provide Concurrency, for example Collaborative Networks provide a global venue where people from around the world can meet and conduct work virtually
4.	Take Advantage of Non â€“ local Resources that is using compute resources on a wide area network, or even the internet when local compute resources are scarce or insufficient
5.	Make better use of Underlying Parallel Hardware
