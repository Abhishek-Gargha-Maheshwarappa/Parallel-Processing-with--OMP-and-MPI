# Parallel-Processing-with--OMP-and-MPI
# **Several reasons to use parallel computing**

1.	Save time/money
2.	Solve Larger/More Complex problems like Web search engines/databases processing millions of transactions every second
3.	Provide Concurrency, for example Collaborative Networks provide a global venue where people from around the world can meet and conduct work virtually
4.	Take Advantage of Non – local Resources that is using compute resources on a wide area network, or even the internet when local compute resources are scarce or insufficient
5.	Make better use of Underlying Parallel Hardware

# **Parallel Programming Models**

There are several parallel programming models in common use:
•	Shared Memory (without threads)
•	Threads
•	Distributed Memory / Message Passing
•	Data Parallel
•	Hybrid
•	SPMD and MPMD
